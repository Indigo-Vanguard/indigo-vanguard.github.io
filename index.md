title: There is No Plan Bee Without Them
---

# Introduction (Arthur): The bees are dying. Talk about CCD. Several causes possible. No single cause highlighted.
- Show correlation (3D scatterplot) for varroa and pesticide.
- As there's no linear correlation, we say there's no single factor to explain bee death

# How heavily are they dying? US case study (Arthur)
- Heatmap US honey deaths (Average yearly loss [%] per state) (with toggle) => show that california is a deathbed 
- Segue: migratory bee-keeping (California: Almond, Texas, North Dakota)

# Is there a real effect of those deaths? (Tim)
- Case study almonds to show that the death of bees doesn't really affect agricultural production
- Plot almond production
- Segue: The influence on the world honey economy

# Economy of honey production in the world
1. How do countries exploit their behives ? (Robin)
    - Bubble plot (y: honey prod, x: amount beehive) of countries (color = continent ?) per year (slider + animation). See [here](https://plot.ly/python/animations/)
2. What are the import/export patterns ?
    - Scatterplot x: import as a percentage of consumption, y: export as a percentage of production, size: production, color: continent, animation through years See [here](https://plot.ly/python/animations/) (Eric)
    - We cluster the scatter plot to highlight x types of countries (e.g. self-sufficient ones)
    - Eric's map
3. We noticed countries that exported a lot. Are there issues with them ? (Hopefully yes) (Tim)
    - Heatmap ratio honey prod / beehives, slider over time

# Conclusion
Bees are dying, honey is thriving, don't buy chinese.
